Although the game is playable as it is, its more of a template than a game. Game can be easily expanded with new enemies, upgrades and even game mechanics. This game was mode with intention to learn new skills in Unity engine, not to make a full-fledged game.
This game was made with phone compability in mind and can easily by ported to mobile devices.
